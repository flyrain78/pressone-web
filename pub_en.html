              <h2 id="publish-alert">Risk Notice!</h2>
              <p>
                Please carefully read the following items. Read every word of each item,
                and please think carefully about the implications of each word and sentence.
                You must be sure that you truly understand before continuing to read the rest of the user’s guide.
              </p>
              <p>
                As with any project, it is impossible to guarantee the success of the project at the start…
              </p>
              <p>
                Once again: this project has a certain risk of failure, and furthermore,
                the tokens issued by the project could become worthless! Please invest with caution! Think carefully before you invest!
              </p>
              <p>
                The first principle of a qualified investor is: don’t invest if you don’t understand.
                Don’t invest in projects that you don’t understand, and don’t have this stupid idea:
                “I don’t understand, but I trust you!” It’s a fact that this sort of investor doesn’t usually have good results.
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite the fact that this product has a minimum viable test version,
                an internal beta version will not start for three months,
                and it will be at least nine months before a public beta will be released.
                That is to say, investors without patience who cannot wait for the long term should absolutely not participate.
              </p>
              <p>
                Until we have enough certainty,
                the tokens issued by this project will not be made available on exchanges.
                Investors who hope to quickly enter and exit should not participate.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once trading for the project’s tokens is opened up, it is quite possible that there won’t be the 10x or more returns
                that many people imagine, so any investors who expect to become rich overnight should not participate.
              </p>
              <p>
                All investors please take notice: **Absolutely do not invest too much!** 10% of investible assets
                is already a huge risk; please only invest an amount that you can lose. Risk is not decided only by probability,
                it is decided to an even greater degree by the size of your bet. Please make sure you have a deep understanding of this.
              </p>
              <p>
                The resoluteness felt in a bull market will vanish into thin air in a bear market.
                Sooner or later you will experience this: most people turn to fear when the going gets tough.
                If you don’t believe you can make it through one or more bull/bear market cycles,
                then please don’t participate… It will seriously influence your quality of life.
              </p>
              <p>
                A bear market could come at any time; if you can’t make it through a deep winter, then just don’t participate.
              </p>
              <p>
                It’s always been the case that very few people like to tell the hard truths:
              </p>
