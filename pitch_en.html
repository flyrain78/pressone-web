						If Bitcoin is the first successful blockchain application that
						revolutionized the business model of banks in a decentralized way,
						then PressOne will revolutionize the business model of the press
						by decentralizing how content providers connect and get rewarded.
					</textarea>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						PressOne will possibly become the biggest public chain on the Internet.

						Since the Internet comprises of contents, such as texts, images, sounds or videos,
						revolutionizing existing distribution channels may well mean to "reconstruct the whole Internet".

						PressOne will quite possibly become the most natural and profuse public chain of
						DAPPs (decentralized applications).
					</textarea>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						Content-creation business consists of three parts: production, discovery and distribution.

						Production must be provided by outstanding individuals or teams,
						and thus it does not have to be decentralized.
					</textarea>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						Discovery and distribution, however, are where a decentralized network gains an edge…

						By decentralizing discovery and distribution,
						content producers no longer need to rely on one or a few parties to
						compensate them for producing content - rather, they are rewarded by the crowd.
					</textarea>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						When a piece of work is finished, the market will take care of the rest.
						Releasing a new work means publishing a new "asset" (the securitization of content),
						and its value will be proved by the market.

						In this way, the producer, discoverer and distributor's roles may overlap,
						but any of them could seek profit from any of these activities.
					</textarea>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						Using a real-name system in decentralized protocols is not nearly scary
						as some people have imagined.
						On the contrary, it may encourage people to make reliable comments…

						If anyone intends to hide his/her identity,
						then luckily they have no worries —
						for there are countless other ways and places on the Internet that one can assume anonymity...
					</textarea>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						Sensible censorship by the decentralized protocol is also not terrifying,
						for it can enhance the quality of contents. and keep the community members safe.

						Censorship does not always constrain freedom for a similar reason:
						if one hates censorship, plenty of ways and places are available on the Internet.
					</textarea>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						PressOne is not merely a Chinese project.
						The mechanisms it provides are the same for people of any nationality,
						race, gender, language, etc.

						Nor is PressOne a competitor of Steem.
						In fact, we are collaborators — complementary to meet different needs.
					</textarea>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						Traditional "whitepapers" will not be provided before the official launch of PressOne
						(truth is, rarely do people read or understand whitepapers).

						When PressOne will be officially released,
						ever-perfecting documentations will be provided to support succeeding developers.
					</textarea>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						Based on PressOne, developers and operators can easily
						build various content circles, social media, etc.

						This will not be just a game for tech geeks,
						but an invaluable opportunity for all to ride on the latest trend.
						They don't need to know technologies or blockchain —
						just like anybody can use cash without profound financial knowledge.
					</textarea>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						PressOne can be imagined as a giant incubator.
						We will organize "campaigns" for entities that intend to grow vertically,
						and circle members will select the best candidates or teams possible to "go on the expedition".
					</textarea>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						PressOne is not a company — in the blockchain world,
						a company entity is not theoretically necessary.
						The ideal objective of a successful blockchain project is to
						build a decentralized self-autonomous enterprise/organization.

						All of the rules should be written in the smart contract,
						rather than enforced by management.
						Only in this way can it be sustainable and scalable.
					</textarea>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						Why us?

						First, we are based in China, a country with world's most Internet users.
						Second, Chinese developers are global leaders in user experience.
						Our dev team come from all over the world,
						and their work experience in the blockchain world adds up to more than a hundred years.

						We also have massive resources: simply imagine knewone.com built on PressOne…
