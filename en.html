              The time has come for centralized content distribution models to be disrupted.
            </p>
          </header>


          <div class="row gap-y align-items-center">
            <div class="col-12 col-md-7">
              <h4>Current problems of centralized publishing and distribution models</h4>
              <p>
                Because accounts are not public,
                the cost to publishers of cheating approaches zero; sales figures are not necessarily accurate,
                so royalties due to creators are often secretly embezzled.
                Fake sales figures have in effect become a common “sales tactic”,
                so “non-standard calculation of royalties” has become commonplace.
                On the one hand, the monopoly of publishers gives them incentive to present poor work as quality work;
                at the same time, it has led to a decline in their ability to select quality work (this ability is often even lower than average).
              </p>
              <p>
                However, an even bigger problem is the distribution of benefits in the content industry.
                If benefits were distributed more reasonably, a lot of problems could be easily solved.
                To take books as an example, authors usually receive a royalty of 7-15%, and printing costs are around 10%
                (depending on printing numbers and design).
                What happens to the other 75%? It goes to many links in the process that actually have absolutely no reason to exist…
                In the Internet age, even the printing costs can be removed, right?
              </p>

            <div class="col-12 col-md-7">
              <h4>Use decentralization to reconstruct the system’s distribution of benefits</h4>
              <p>
                The remarkable thing about the blockchain as the underlying protocol of the new Internet is that
                all applications built using it as a base naturally have an essentially independent economic system,
                so developers can use smart contracts to define the principles of benefit distribution for this new economic system.
              </p>
              <p>
                After decentralization (or we could say after “disintermediation”,
                since publishers often merely act as an intermediary that could be replaced by machines or programs),
                the content industry is only left with two basic roles: Producer and User,
                thus a reallocation of benefits can easily be very effective.

            <div class="col-12 col-md-7">
              <h4>New content types in new system</h4>
              <p>
                Content will only be divided into two types: paid content and paying content.
                I have content, you want to see it, you must pay me. This is paid content — novels, music, movies, and TV shows are all of this type.
                I have some other content, I want to pay you to see it — ads are of this type of content.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this very simple system, free content doesn’t exist, and has no reason to exist,
                because payments can be extremely low.
                But, content must be either paid or paying, and even if the payment is very close to zero,
                it must be greater than zero — this point is very important, and it is an extremely effective method of eliminating 99.99% of spam.

              <h4>User behavior in new system</h4>
              <p>
                There are two types of evaluation: prevent further circulation (negative)
                and promote further circulation or share (positive).
              </p>
              <p>
                Promoting the circulation of good content and preventing the circulation of poor content is good for the entire system.
                Conversely, promoting the circulation of poor content and preventing the circulation of good content is bad for the system.
                Therefore, a consensus mechanism can be used to grade active users, allowing the system to judge user activity with a credibility rating.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once a user has shared content,
                they have effectively exercised their “distribution ability”,
                so they should receive a “distribution reward paid according to results”.
                A share will trigger more shares, and in a world of digital currency,
                a multi-level distribution system should be more easily realized.

              <h4>A content publishing revolution</h4>
              <p>
                In this decentralized system, since the intermediaries have been replaced by systems and programs,
                in addition to the system’s effectiveness being greatly increased,
                the costs of operation of the system are greatly reduced.
              </p>
              <p>
                And of the three main activities of the content industry (production, discovery, and distribution),
                two (discovery and distribution) are completely carried out by the user.
                In addition, the new benefit distribution method gives them sufficient motivation to do a better job…
              </p>
              <p>
                Another effect is that production will be better,
                and quality producers will be rewarded —
                all they need to do is ensure that they create things that the world really needs,
                and they have no need to worry that their talents will go unrecognized…

                <h5>Ecosystem and Incubator</h5>
                <br>
                <p>
                  No one application can “satisfy all needs”,
                  so many types of applications can be developed on this public chain.
                  Press.One is not simply an EOS application,
                  but more like a blockchain application incubator.
                  On the basis of Press.One, we will invest in and develop many specific applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This might be a small opportunity for developers to quickly enter the top level of the blockchain world.
                  Most of the funds raised from the ICO will be invested into the incubator,
                  and Press.One will gradually build a rich content distribution system through training, incubation, and acceleration.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first Press.One application is easy to understand:
                  it is a content distribution system based on strong ties.
                  In fact, you have seen this before, as the WeChat Public Platform is this type of system.
                  It’s just that Press.One has added smart contracts, and is not only displayed in a real-time communication tool…
                </p>
              </div>


              <div class="col-12 col-md-6 p-60">
                <p class="iconbox iconbox-xxl">

                <br><br>
                <h5>Implementation</h5>
                <br>
                <p>
                  From a design perspective, we will divide the system into two layers.
                  You can think of the base layer as “the operating system”,
                  and the top layer as “applications”.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Elements such as the transparent, open and irrevocable accounts, the decentralized data storage,
                  and the basic structure for smart contracts will go in the base layer.
                  The top layer applications, such as those used to handle the business logic,
                  actually do not require the decentralized process.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The development process will be parallel.
                  Since Press.One is based on the EOS basic framework, the base layer development will stay in line with the EOS roadmap.
                  Before the EOS public beta, we will complete the first,
                  non-blockchain private and public beta of the Press.One application,
                  in which all of the system’s smart contracts will be “mock contracts”.
                  Once the EOS public beta is released, we will develop a public chain based on EOS, and quickly complete the switch of the base layer.

                    Nicknames may be used in the system,
                    but at its core the system should be a real-name registration user system.
                    Only users who have completed real-name registration will be able to publish,
                    comment and share content.
                    Because each user action goes along with a transaction that is guaranteed by smart contracts,
                    a real-name system is a necessary component for the system’s culture and safety.

                  <p>
                    Real-name registration is already the most effective method of content filtering.
                    We believe that unlimited freedom of speech is not a good thing,
                    as some forms of speech are poisonous, or even harmful to humanity.
                    It is possible to use a “consensus mechanism”,
                    one of the principles of the blockchain,
                    to realize a “reasonable content filtering mechanism based on consensus”.

                  <h5>Irrevocability</h5>
                  <p>
                    There is some data that should be irrevocable.
                    Date stamps, for instance, are one of the key factors for determining copyright.
                    But other data, such as many versions and drafts before a final version,
                    does not in theory need to be “irrevocable”. Other data may even need to be destroyed,
                    such as child pornography. Thus, the data on the public chain is not necessarily complete data,
                    but is a hash signed by three parties, and smart contracts can in certain specific situations
                    destroy the private key of the encrypted data.

                  <h5>Anti-spam Mechanism</h5>
                  <p>
                    In addition to spam advertisements, all kinds of piracy and plagiarism can be considered spam.
                    While it’s difficult to completely eliminate spam,
                    we can use the principle of “forcing all content to transact” to greatly reduce the amount of spam.
                    Because this is a real-name registration system, piracy will reduce a users credibility, greatly increasing the “cost of crime”.

                  <h5>Currency Recovery Mechanism</h5>
                  <p>
                    The system will receive a certain amount of the distributed benefits.
                    Looking at it from another perspective,
                    this is in effect the currency recovery mechanism of an economic system —
                    this type of currency recovery system will in turn stimulate the circulation of the currency in the economic system.

                  <h5>Transactions Between Applications</h5>
                  <p>
                    Even though users will quite possible use a single open account system,
                    they may hold multiple types of tokens.
                    However, because each conversion can in fact be seamlessly executed using smart contracts,
                    this will not necessarily cause problems.
